## Intel® Bug Bounty Program

Intel Corporation believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe
is a crucial part of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in Intel products.

Like other major technology companies, Intel incentivizes security researchers to report
security vulnerabilities in Intel products to us to enable a coordinated response. To
encourage closer collaboration with the security research community on these kinds of issues,
Intel created its Bug Bounty Program.

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in an Intel product or technology, we
encourage you to notify us through our program and work with us to mitigate and to coordinate
disclosure of the vulnerability.
