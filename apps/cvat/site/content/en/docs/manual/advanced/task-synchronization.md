> Notice: this feature works only if a git repository was specified when the task was created.

1. At the end of the annotation process, a task is synchronized by clicking
   `Synchronize` on the task page. If the synchronization is successful,
   the button will change to `Sychronized` in blue:

1. The annotation is now in the repository in a temporary branch.
   The next step is to go to the repository and manually create a pull request to the main branch.

1. After merging the PR, when the annotation is saved in the main branch,
   the button changes to `Merged` and is highlighted in green.

If annotation in the task does not correspond annotations in the repository, the sync button will turn red:
