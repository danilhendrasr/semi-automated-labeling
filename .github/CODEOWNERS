# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence, they will
# be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies components below, only the list of owners and not
# the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
