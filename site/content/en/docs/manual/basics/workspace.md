This is the main field in which drawing and editing objects takes place.
In addition the workspace also has the following functions:

- Right-clicking on an object calls up the `Object card` - this is an element containing
  the necessary controls for changing the label and attributes of the object, as well as the action menu.

- Right-clicking a point deletes it.

- `Z-axis slider` - Allows you to switch annotation layers hiding the upper layers
  (slider is enabled if several z layers are on a frame).
  This element has a button for adding a new layer. When pressed, a new layer is added and switched to it.
  You can move objects in layers using the `+` and `-` keys.

- `Image settings panel` -  used to set up the grid and set up image brightness contrast saturation.

  - Show `Grid`, change grid size, choose color and transparency:

  - Adjust `Brightness`/`Contrast`/`Saturation` of too exposed or too
  dark images using `F3` — color settings (changes displaying settings and not the
  image itself).

  Shortcuts:

  - `Shift+B+=`/`Shift+B+-` for brightness.
  - `Shift+C+=`/`Shift+C+-` for contrast.
  - `Shift+S+=`/`Shift+S+-` for saturation.
