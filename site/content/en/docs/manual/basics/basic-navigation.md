1. Use arrows below to move to the next/previous frame.
   Use the scroll bar slider to scroll through frames.

1. To navigate the image, use the button on the controls sidebar.
   Another way an image can be moved/shifted is by holding the left mouse button inside
   an area without annotated objects.
   If the `Mouse Wheel` is pressed, then all annotated objects are ignored. Otherwise the
   a highlighted bounding box will be moved instead of the image itself.

1. You can use the button on the sidebar controls to zoom on a region of interest.
   Use the button `Fit the image` to fit the image in the workspace.
   You can also use the mouse wheel to scale the image
   (the image will be zoomed relatively to your current cursor position).
