This feature allows us to group several shapes.

You may use the `Group Shapes` button or shortcuts:

- `G` — start selection / end selection in group mode
- `Esc` — close group mode
- `Shift+G` — reset group for selected shapes

You may select shapes clicking on them or selecting an area.

Grouped shapes will have `group_id` filed in dumped annotation.

Also you may switch color distribution from an instance (default) to a group.
You have to switch `Color By Group` checkbox for that.

Shapes that don't have `group_id`, will be highlighted in white.
